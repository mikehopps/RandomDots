    //Methods!
    //1.  getX() -> returns x
    //2.  getY() -> returns y

    //3.  draw(Graphics2D g2) -> draws this dot (drawOval with w,h = 1,1)

    //4.  public Dot getMidpoint(Dot other){
    //      returns the Dot that is the midpoint of THIS Dot
    //      and the parameter other Dot.
    //      recall the midpoint formula: ( (x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2 )
