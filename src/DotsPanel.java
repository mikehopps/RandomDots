        //1.  Go finish the Dot class.
        //2.  Make a few Dots and their midpoints and draw them to test your work.
        //      Once satisfied with your results, delete your test code.
        //3.  Go up to the constructor.

        //4.  Create a Dot called currentDot.  Have it represent the center of the screen.

        //5.  Pick one of the 3 instance field Dots at random, I'll call it picked.
        //6.  Assign currentDot to be the midpoint of currentDot and the picked Dot.
        //7.  Draw currentDot.

        //8.  Modify your code so that steps 5-7 are repeated 10,000 times.

        //9.  Bask in the glory of the result.
        //10. Modify colors, shapes, etc as much as you want.  Make it more awesome.
